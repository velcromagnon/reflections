What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	It creates a hidden .git directory and sets up the repository to be able to take commits. Otherwise, you won't be able to take commits and get history (getting any Git functionality)

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	The repository is where you have committed your changes, and they are finalized.
	The staging area is an intermediate where you can decide which changes are to be committed.
	The working directory is the file structure, list of all files, including those not yet committed.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
